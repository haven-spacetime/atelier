Run the full test suite and analyze any failures.

1. Run `npm run test`
2. If any tests fail, read the failing test file and the source file it tests
3. Determine whether the bug is in the test or the source code
4. Fix the issue and re-run tests until all pass
5. Report results: total tests, pass count, fail count, and what was fixed
